# AndroidWearOrienter
Orients Android Wear Unity apps properly. If you were not aware, most Android Wear devices consider their natural orientation `portrait`. So far, there has been one exception to this, the 1st generation Moto 360, which considers its orientation `landscape-left`. This small lib seeks to set up proper orientation.

# Basic Usage
